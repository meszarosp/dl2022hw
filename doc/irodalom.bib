abstract={This study proposes a multilayer hybrid deep-learning system (MHS) to automatically sort waste disposed of by individuals in the urban public area. This system deploys a high-resolution camera to capture waste image and sensors to detect other useful feature information. The MHS uses a CNN-based algorithm to extract image features and a multilayer perceptrons (MLP) method to consolidate image features and other feature information to classify wastes as recyclable or the others. The MHS is trained and validated against the manually labelled items, achieving overall classification accuracy higher than 90{\&}{\#}x0025; under two different testing scenarios, which significantly outperforms a reference CNN-based method relying on image-only inputs.},

	abstract = {The accumulation of solid waste in the urban area is becoming a great concern, and it would result in environmental pollution and may be hazardous to human health if it is not properly managed. It is important to have an advanced/intelligent waste management system to manage a variety of waste materials. One of the most important steps of waste management is the separation of the waste into the different components and this process is normally done manually by hand-picking. To simplify the process, we propose an intelligent waste material classification system, which is developed by using the 50-layer residual net pre-train (ResNet-50) Convolutional Neural Network model which is a machine learning tool and serves as the extractor, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) which is used to classify the waste into different groups/types such as glass, metal, paper, and plastic etc. The proposed system is tested on the trash image dataset which was developed by Gary Thung and Mindy Yang, and is able to achieve an accuracy of 87% on the dataset. The separation process of the waste will be faster and intelligent using the proposed waste material classification system without or reducing human involvement.}

	abstract = {Recycling of waste from households and industries, is one of the methods that has been proposed to reduce the ever-increasing pressure on landfills. Different types of waste types warrant different management techniques and hence, proper waste segregation according to its types is essential to facilitate proper recycling. Current existing segregation method still relies on manual hand-picking process. In this paper, a method; based on deep learning and computer vision concepts, to classify wastes using their images into six different waste types (glass, metal, paper, plastic, cardboard and others) has been proposed. Multiple-layered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, specifically the well-known Inception-v3 model has been used for classification of waste, with trained dataset obtained from online sources. High classification accuracy of 92.5% is achievable using the proposed method. It is envisaged that the proposed waste classification method would pave the way for the automation of waste segregation with reduced human involvement and therefore, helps with the waste recycling efforts.},
