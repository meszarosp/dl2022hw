## Abstract

---

The goal of our project is to create a machine learning solution that is able to recognize commonly found recyclable waste (e.g. cardboard, metal, plastic) and separate it from non-recyclable trash. We will be using 8 different categories (cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, trash, e-waste and medical waste) based on how recycling is supposed to be sorted, and what annotations the datasets we employ have. (Dataset 1: https://www.kaggle.com/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification , Dataset 2: https://www.kaggle.com/mostafaabla/garbage-classification , Dataset 3: https://github.com/nikhilvenkatkumsetty/TrashBox ) 

Our plan is to use multiple CNNs that are pre-trained on computer vision classification problems and use transfer learning to make them an appropriate fit for our more specific task.
